## How to Submit an Issue or Suggestion

To submit an issue or suggestion, please follow these steps:

1. **Check for existing issues**: Before submitting a new issue or suggestion, please search the tracker to ensure that it hasn't been reported or suggested before. This helps us avoid duplicates and allows us to focus on resolving unique problems and implementing new ideas.

2. **Create a new issue**: If you couldn't find a similar issue or suggestion, click on the ["Issues"](../../issues) tab above and then click the ["New Issue"](../../issues/new/choose) button. Provide a descriptive title that summarizes the problem or suggestion concisely.

3. **Provide details**: In the issue description, provide as much information as possible to help us understand the problem or suggestion. Include clear steps to reproduce the issue or a detailed explanation of the enhancement you're suggesting. You can also attach relevant screenshots or files to support your submission.

4. **Label and assign**: Once you've created the issue, please assign the appropriate labels that best categorize the problem or suggestion. This helps us organize and prioritize the issues accordingly. If you're a team member responsible for managing this tracker, you can assign the issue to yourself or the relevant person for further action.

5. **Engage in discussion**: Feel free to engage in the discussion by providing additional details, asking questions, or clarifying any points raised by other community members or our team. Your input is valuable, and together we can find the best solutions and ideas.

6. **Track progress**: As we work on addressing the issues or implementing the suggestions, we will update the status and provide relevant comments. You can subscribe to notifications to stay informed about the progress.
